### 🧐 What makes Tripetto a better form builder plugin? ###

💡 With the Tripetto form builder plugin you create stunning custom form experiences instead of boring forms. You can use all your forms in three form layouts, also named 'form faces' in Tripetto:

- **Autoscroll form face**: the autoscroll form face presents one question at a time and is akin to Typeform’s conversational forms;
- **Chat form face**: the chat form face presents all questions and answers as speech bubbles and is partly inspired by Landbot;
- **Classic form face**: the classic form face presents question fields in a traditional form as often seen in SurveyMonkey and the likes.

Just use the form face that suits your form and purpose best. <a href="https://tripetto.com/form-layouts/" rel="friend" title="More info about form faces" target="_blank">See all form layouts.</a>

💡 With the Tripetto form builder plugin you create smart forms that react to the given answers of your respondents. That’s why we call them conversational forms. To help you with this, our unique visual form builder easily lets you create the right logic, like **branch logic**, **jump logic** and **pipe logic**. <a href="https://tripetto.com/logic-types/" rel="friend" title="More info about logic" target="_blank">Learn more about form logic.</a>

💡 With the Tripetto form builder plugin you create interactive quizzes, order forms, exams and more with the **calculator block**. Use the given answers of your respondents to perform any calculation you need in your form. The calculator block can add, subtract, multiply and divide, but also supports formulas and advanced mathematical functions. The result: fully no-code calculator forms! <a href="https://tripetto.com/calculator/" rel="friend" title="More info about the calculator block" target="_blank">Learn more about calculations.</a>

💡 With the Tripetto form builder plugin you create beautiful responsive forms that match your website perfectly, with custom **welcome and end screens**, advanced **styling options** and **full translations**.
